# Detailed Comparison of GVEC Python vs field_gvec.f90 Implementations

## 1. Notation Mapping

In GVEC Python:
- `t` = theta (θ) - poloidal angle
- `z` = zeta (ζ) - toroidal angle  
- `r` = rho (ρ) - radial/flux coordinate

So the notation mapping is:
- `dLA_dt` (Python) = `dLA_dthet` (Fortran) = ∂Λ/∂θ
- `dLA_dz` (Python) = `dLA_dzeta` (Fortran) = ∂Λ/∂ζ
- `Jac` (Python) = `sqrtG` (Fortran) = √g (Jacobian)

## 2. Magnetic Field Formula Comparison

### GVEC Python (quantities.py lines 532-534):
```python
ds["B_contra_t"] = (ds.iota - ds.dLA_dz) * ds.dPhi_dr / ds.Jac
ds["B_contra_z"] = (1 + ds.dLA_dt) * ds.dPhi_dr / ds.Jac
ds["B"] = ds.B_contra_t * ds.e_theta + ds.B_contra_z * ds.e_zeta
```

### field_gvec.f90 (lines 261-268):
```fortran
B_thet = (iota_val - dLA_dzeta) * phiPrime_val / sqrtG  ! B^θ contravariant
B_zeta = (1.0_wp + dLA_dthet) * phiPrime_val / sqrtG    ! B^ζ contravariant
Bx = B_thet * e_thet(1) + B_zeta * e_zeta(1)
By = B_thet * e_thet(2) + B_zeta * e_zeta(2)
Bz = B_thet * e_thet(3) + B_zeta * e_zeta(3)
```

**Verdict**: The formulas are IDENTICAL! Both compute:
- B^θ = (ι - ∂Λ/∂ζ) * Φ'/(√g)
- B^ζ = (1 + ∂Λ/∂θ) * Φ'/(√g)
- B = B^θ * e_θ + B^ζ * e_ζ

## 3. Basis Vector Comparison

### GVEC Python (quantities.py line 478):
```python
ds["e_theta"] = ds.e_q1 * ds.dX1_dt + ds.e_q2 * ds.dX2_dt
```

### field_gvec.f90 (lines 243):
```fortran
e_thet = dx_dq1 * dX1_dthet + dx_dq2 * dX2_dthet
```

Where:
- Python: `e_q1`, `e_q2` are basis vectors in (X1, X2) space
- Fortran: `dx_dq1`, `dx_dq2` are the same, obtained from `hmap_r%get_dx_dqi`

**Verdict**: The basis vector computations are IDENTICAL! Both use:
- e_θ = (∂r/∂X1) * (∂X1/∂θ) + (∂r/∂X2) * (∂X2/∂θ)

## 4. Key Findings

### ✅ Correct Aspects:
1. The magnetic field formulas are identical between Python and Fortran
2. The basis vector computations match exactly
3. Both correctly identify B_thet and B_zeta as contravariant components
4. The Jacobian (sqrtG/Jac) is used consistently
5. The physical field B is computed correctly as B = B^i * e_i

### ✅ Covariant Components:
The Fortran implementation correctly computes covariant components (lines 273-280):
```fortran
! B_i = g_ij * B^j
hcov(1) = g_st * B_thet + g_sz * B_zeta  ! B_s
hcov(2) = g_tt * B_thet + g_tz * B_zeta  ! B_θ  
hcov(3) = g_tz * B_thet + g_zz * B_zeta  ! B_ζ
```

This is the correct tensor contraction for converting contravariant to covariant components.

### ✅ Metric Tensor:
The metric components are computed correctly as dot products of basis vectors:
```fortran
g_ij = e_i · e_j
```

## 5. Conclusion

The field_gvec.f90 implementation is CORRECT and matches the GVEC Python reference implementation exactly:

1. The magnetic field formulas are identical
2. The basis vector computations match
3. The contravariant components B^θ and B^ζ are computed correctly
4. The physical field B is assembled correctly from contravariant components and basis vectors
5. The covariant components are computed correctly using the metric tensor
6. The only difference is notation: Python uses (r,t,z) while Fortran uses (s,θ,ζ)

There are no errors in the magnetic field evaluation logic. The implementation follows the GVEC methodology precisely.
